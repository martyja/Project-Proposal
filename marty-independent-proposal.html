<h1>Project: Jenny Marty Portfolio</h1>
<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>I will be creating a personal professional portfolio website on Squarespace. I will be transferring the information on my current portfolio website, <a href=“jennymartyportfolio.wordpress.com>jennymartyportfolio.wordpress.com</a> as well as adding information and adjusting the presentation of work. I originally created this website for 307. I have since updated it, but am still not satisfied with the format and design of the website. I specifically want to change how I present my past projects. I want to add more information about each in its own page, which you get to by clicking on a single image on the portfolio page. I’m currently in the process of applying for post-grad jobs, and a professional portfolio website is a must for these applications.</p>
<h2>Goals</h2>
